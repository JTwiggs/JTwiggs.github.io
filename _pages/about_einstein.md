Hi, I'm JT. Solving problems and finding solutions has always been something I enjoy, and when I learned about the idea of data science a couple years ago, it sounded awesome! I always enjoyed math, but knew that computer science wasn't quite for me. When I heard that there was a middle ground option, I dove right in. My time spent on this degree has deepened my appreciation and understanding of statistics, machine learning, and just how big of an umbrella term 'data science' is. I have found enjoyment building predictive regression and classification models, as well as how LLM's work and how I can make them work for me. ChatGPT took the world by storm, and I am determined to harness that storm to help in as many ways as I can.
