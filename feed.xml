I need to come up with a better title, one that is a bit more reflective of Crawl4AI’s impact on this project, and somehow tie in the UFC if possible. This went from creating a fun little tool to a much more research based idea. I feel that getting an RAG working with (technically) a single, relatively short, markdown file is already a win. I need to test it some more tomorrow, but the results I was getting looked very promising. I’m still mildly undecided on whether I cater towards the idea of an AI tool, or research specific presentation. Essentially, this semester of researching has lead to three key points that I want to get across in a professional way this week:</p> <p>While I built this workflow to collect information from the ufc homepage, some additional customization could make this collect information about almost any website, given the time to complete a full query. If the files are saved and managed effectively, a personal database of useful websites to use as text embeddings for the model can become extremely powerful. For example, crawling medicare.gov and connecting an RAG model to both a chatbot and a text-to-speech (tts) model would provide genuine value in answering plan specific questions immediately, and add an additional filter on top of those already in place, ensuring that calls that reach agents are using time more effectively, and providing more value to customers.</p> <p>Webscraping is a huge can of worms. Crawl4AI is a package that I happily stumbled across after trying to use other tools and resources for almost a month. I needed clean (enough) markdown files to give to a model so context could be retained and recalled from embeddings, and this managed to simplify the whole experience. The documentation made everything easy to implement, and it is free, which is honestly mind blowing. Customized agentic AI tools have so much potential to save time. Instead of needing all questions routed to someone who knows niche and specific documented information, LLM-based agents have blasted the ceiling wide open in terms of tools and repetitive workflows that can be automated now. I plan to implement some of these ideas during my upcoming internship with an insurance company based out of Southern Utah, and I anticipate each tool saving the company nearly 40 hours of customer support each week, allowing for additional earning potential, or just enough sleep at night.</p> <div class="caption"> Here are a couple of the videos I found really helpful with learning more about not only web crawling, but also text embeddings and RAG models. I am still working on the poster, but I will be sure to include these in the references section. </div> <p>It does also support embedding videos from different sources.

The more I try and understand how RAG models work, the less easy it is for me to understand where I need to be headed. With only a month left before the R&amp;CW event, I don’t think I will be hitting the goals I had set initially when setting out for a senior project. Instead of air quality analysis, the project has leaned much more heavily into AI development. Instead of worrying about a predictive model to compare answers to, I am planning to either scrape data from a secondary source for the model to compare to, or just leave it at 1. Other classes are eating time away from this project, but I’m still planning to have a deliverable on time!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/9-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/7-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/7-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all. </div> <p>Images can be made zoomable.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s break it down: this is possible thanks to <a href="https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook">Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin</a> that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyter nbconvert --to html</code></a> to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/">Kramdown</a> is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions">::nomarkdown</a> tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.</p> <p>The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_exists</code> filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598">Stackoverflow answer</a>. You must indent your code by <strong>(3 * bullet_indent_level)</strong> spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">1.</span> We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
<span class="p">
   1.</span> Like this:<span class="sb">

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

</span><span class="p">   2.</span> The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Which displays:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Like this:</p> <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li> <p>The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers</code> to true in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p> <p>If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:</p> <p>{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}</p> <p>The keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linenos</code> triggers display of line numbers. Produces something like this:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
