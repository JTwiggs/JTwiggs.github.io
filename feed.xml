I need to come up with a better title, one that is a bit more reflective of Crawl4AI’s impact on this project, and somehow tie in the UFC if possible. This went from creating a fun little tool to a much more research based idea. I feel that getting an RAG working with (technically) a single, relatively short, markdown file is already a win. I need to test it some more tomorrow, but the results I was getting looked very promising. I’m still mildly undecided on whether I cater towards the idea of an AI tool, or research specific presentation. Essentially, this semester of researching has lead to three key points that I want to get across in a professional way this week:</p> <p>While I built this workflow to collect information from the ufc homepage, some additional customization could make this collect information about almost any website, given the time to complete a full query. If the files are saved and managed effectively, a personal database of useful websites to use as text embeddings for the model can become extremely powerful. For example, crawling medicare.gov and connecting an RAG model to both a chatbot and a text-to-speech (tts) model would provide genuine value in answering plan specific questions immediately, and add an additional filter on top of those already in place, ensuring that calls that reach agents are using time more effectively, and providing more value to customers.</p> <p>Webscraping is a huge can of worms. Crawl4AI is a package that I happily stumbled across after trying to use other tools and resources for almost a month. I needed clean (enough) markdown files to give to a model so context could be retained and recalled from embeddings, and this managed to simplify the whole experience. The documentation made everything easy to implement, and it is free, which is honestly mind blowing. Customized agentic AI tools have so much potential to save time. Instead of needing all questions routed to someone who knows niche and specific documented information, LLM-based agents have blasted the ceiling wide open in terms of tools and repetitive workflows that can be automated now. I plan to implement some of these ideas during my upcoming internship with an insurance company based out of Southern Utah, and I anticipate each tool saving the company nearly 40 hours of customer support each week, allowing for additional earning potential, or just enough sleep at night.</p> <div class="caption"> Here are a couple of the videos I found really helpful with learning more about not only web crawling, but also text embeddings and RAG models. I am still working on the poster, but I will be sure to include these in the references section. </div> <p>It does also support embedding videos from different sources.

This has been done by way of the python library <a href="https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai">Crawl4AI</a>, and has made life quite a bit less stressful. At this point, I don’t think that there will be a secondary source of information, as RAG models are made to check markdown files, not necessarily call predictive models. We still have a couple weeks, so it might be possible, but that is no longer something I am aiming for. Hopefully by this time next week, there will be a model built in <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a> and/or <a href="https://www.langchain.com/">Langchain</a> alongside a UI with <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="seniorProject"/><category term="n8n"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The week before the R&CW conference.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 11 - Crawl4AI</title><link href="https://jtwiggs.github.io/blog/2025/Week11/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 11 - Crawl4AI"/><published>2025-03-19T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-19T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jtwiggs.github.io/blog/2025/Week11</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jtwiggs.github.io/blog/2025/Week11/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an example post with videos.

The more I try and understand how RAG models work, the less easy it is for me to understand where I need to be headed. With only a month left before the R&amp;CW event, I don’t think I will be hitting the goals I had set initially when setting out for a senior project. Instead of air quality analysis, the project has leaned much more heavily into AI development. Instead of worrying about a predictive model to compare answers to, I am planning to either scrape data from a secondary source for the model to compare to, or just leave it at 1. Other classes are eating time away from this project, but I’m still planning to have a deliverable on time!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/9-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/7-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/7-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all. </div> <p>Images can be made zoomable.
