### Career Fair

There was a huge career fair this week, and while I am still feeling pretty under the weather, I felt that it would have been a huge waste not to go and talk to some potential employers about internship opportunities. Writing about this from a week later, I unfortunately missed some basic (but small) errors on my resume, but I had some printed, and got to hand out about 5 at the event. On top of that, I was better able to see what languages, skills, and directions that some of these companies were looking for. For all the applications and potential, I only got two interviews out of it. The biggest drawback of my resume is lacking work experience, and I need work experience to land a job... This is such a fun game.
