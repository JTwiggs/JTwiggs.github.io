### Researching RAG's

This week wasn’t great so far as progress. The more I try and understand how RAG models work, the less easy it is for me to understand where I need to be headed. With only a month left before the R&CW event, I don’t think I will be hitting the goals I had set initially when setting out for a senior project. Instead of air quality analysis, the project has leaned much more heavily into AI development. Instead of worrying about a predictive model to compare answers to, I am planning to either scrape data from a secondary source for the model to compare to, or just leave it at 1. Other classes are eating time away from this project, but I'm still planning to have a deliverable on time!
