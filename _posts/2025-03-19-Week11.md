Things are really getting down to the wire; I finally got a reliable way of extracting data from websites that is ingestible and instantaneously prepped for AI use. This has been done by way of the python library Crawl4AI, and has made life quite a bit less stressful. At this point, I donâ€™t think that there will be a secondary source of information, as RAG models are made to check markdown files, not necessarily call predictive models. We still have a couple weeks, so it might be possible, but that is no longer something I am aiming for. Hopefully by this time next week, there will be a model built in n8n and or Langchain alongside a UI with boost.diy. 

<!-- <div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

It does also support embedding videos from different sources. Here are some examples: -->

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6LbW2IFUQw&list=PLyrg3m7Ei-MqNM-au_lfjzTsuVVTTx0ke&index=4&pp=iAQB" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I&t=731s" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Here are a couple of the videos I found to be fairly insightful and helpful in building out the model and tools I needed.
