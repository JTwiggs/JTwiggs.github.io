This has been one of the best weeks of the semester so far as progress goes. I've found a much more specific tool to use for this project in the python library <a href ='https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai'>Crawl4AI</a>. Some of the key features include:
- asynchronous crawling
- Markdown formatting 
- Content targeting
- much, much more...

This package has extensive documentation and I would highly recommend checking it out. Moving on to the resource that lead to me finding Crawl4AI in the first place, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ColeMedin">Cole Medin's channel</a> on YouTube. He not only has really insightful videos on agentic AI, but his project ideas are fascinating to follow along with. I've made reference to a couple of them in my research poster, and a link to the video that introduced me to his content is linked below. I feel like there is a great balance between technical explanations and beginner explanations. Additionally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pixegami">pixelgami</a> is another channel that has great tutorials for creating RAG models in a simply explained way. I've also linked the video that was extremely helpful in this project below. I haven't quite gotten the code working as of this post, so I will continue working on that and hopefully have a working model by next week.

        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>

    </div>

<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

It does also support embedding videos from different sources. Here are some examples: -->

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6LbW2IFUQw&list=PLyrg3m7Ei-MqNM-au_lfjzTsuVVTTx0ke&index=4&pp=iAQB" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I&t=731s" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    Here are  the videos I found to be fairly insightful and helpful in building out the model and tools I needed.
