### This Semester is Wrapping Up! - Week 12

Things are really getting down to the wire; I finally got a reliable way of extracting data from websites that is ingestible and instantaneously prepped for AI use. This has been done by way of the python library <a href ='https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai'>Crawl4AI</a>, and has made life quite a bit less stressful. At this point, I donâ€™t think that there will be a secondary source of information, as RAG models are made to check markdown files, not necessarily call predictive models. We still have a couple weeks, so it might be possible, but that is no longer something I am aiming for. Hopefully by this time next week, there will be a model built in <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a> and/or <a href="https://www.langchain.com/">Langchain</a> alongside a UI with <a href='https://streamlit.io/'>Streamlit</a>.
