With a model working adequately as of Monday, I am super excited to say I have finally decided on what would be the most beneficial area to focus on with my presentation at this conference: How web crawling can bolster the usefulness of RAG models. I need to come up with a better title, one that is a bit more reflective of Crawl4AI’s impact on this project, and somehow tie in the UFC if possible. This went from creating a fun little tool to a much more research based idea. I feel that getting an RAG working with (technically) a single, relatively short, markdown file is already a win. I need to test it some more tomorrow, but the results I was getting looked very promising. I’m still mildly undecided on whether I cater towards the idea of an AI tool, or research specific presentation. Essentially, this semester of researching has lead to three key points that I want to get across in a professional way this week:

While I built this workflow to collect information from the ufc homepage, some additional customization could make this collect information about almost any website, given the time to complete a full query. If the files are saved and managed effectively, a personal database of useful websites to use as text embeddings for the model can become extremely powerful. For example, crawling medicare.gov and connecting an RAG model to both a chatbot and a text-to-speech (tts) model would provide genuine value in answering plan specific questions immediately, and add an additional filter on top of those already in place, ensuring that calls that reach agents are using time more effectively, and providing more value to customers.

Webscraping is a huge can of worms. Crawl4AI is a package that I happily stumbled across after trying to use other tools and resources for almost a month. I needed clean (enough) markdown files to give to a model so context could be retained and recalled from embeddings, and this managed to simplify the whole experience. The documentation made everything easy to implement, and it is free, which is honestly mind blowing. 
Customized agentic AI tools have so much potential to save time. Instead of needing all questions routed to someone who knows niche and specific documented information, LLM-based agents have blasted the ceiling wide open in terms of tools and repetitive workflows that can be automated now. I plan to implement some of these ideas during my upcoming internship with an insurance company based out of Southern Utah, and I anticipate each tool saving the company nearly 40 hours of customer support each week, allowing for additional earning potential, or just enough sleep at night.

    Here are a couple of the videos I found really helpful with learning more about not only web crawling, but also text embeddings and RAG models. I am still working on the poster, but I will be sure to include these in the references section.

It does also support embedding videos from different sources. Here are some examples:
