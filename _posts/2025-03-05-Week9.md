### Researching RAG's

This week I set about learning now to work with jekyll themes, and have chosen a new template to host my portfolio with. The Al-folio template is very easy to understand, and looks great to me. I spent most of my time this week getting a hand on what can and cannot be edited within each of the pages. Well... Everything can be customized, but I am not versed in web development so it felt like I was breaking code far more often than I was customizing it. By next week, I should have my about me page and resume page updated to reflect me instead of good old Albert Einstein.
